Greenhow Digital - Dynamic Google Ads Scripts
Welcome to Greenhow Digital's collection of Google Ads scripts. We provide these scripts to help automate and enhance your Google Ads campaigns, and are happy to share our knowledge and expertise with the broader community.

Description
These scripts are designed to perform various tasks, such as dynamically adjusting the Cost Per Click (CPC) for ads based on current weather conditions, facilitating campaign reporting, and much more. The goal is to provide a set of tools that can be used to automate repetitive tasks, uncover new insights, and optimize the performance of your Google Ads campaigns.

Important Note
Most of our scripts utilize Google Sheets and/or third-party APIs to function correctly. This means you'll almost always need to provide a specific Google Sheets ID or API key for a particular third-party service. Make sure to replace placeholders (like 'GOOGLE DOCS' and 'KEY') with your own actual values to make the script work. The individual script descriptions will guide you on where and what to replace.

Licensing
These scripts are released under a public license, meaning you are free to use and modify them as you see fit. However, we ask that if you use these scripts, you attribute them back to us at Greenhow Digital.

Custom Scripts
In addition to the scripts provided here, Greenhow Digital also offers a custom script writing service. We can create tailored scripts to meet the specific needs of your Google Ads campaigns. Whether you need a script to automate a unique process or a complex solution for large-scale campaigns, we can help.
